## For this game to work, I need to: 
- Generate a random number for .guess-number
- Increment Wins & Losses
    - If totals exceed the random number, I lose
    - If total equals the random number, I win
- Set each jewel to equal a specific number
- The sum of each jewel to populate for the 'Your Total Score' field
-
